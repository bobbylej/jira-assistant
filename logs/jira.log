      "description": "# OVERVIEW\nCreate a feature to enable users to record and transcribe voice messages for creating Jira tickets. This functionality will streamline the ticket creation process, enhance accessibility, and improve user experience.\n\n# TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS\n- Develop a user interface for recording voice messages using a microphone input.\n- Implement speech-to-text functionality to transcribe the recorded voice messages accurately.\n- Integrate the transcribed text into the Jira ticket creation form.\n- Ensure compatibility across different devices and browsers.\n- Utilize Web Speech API for speech recognition and transcription.\n- Store the recorded voice messages securely and the transcribed text in the database.\n- Consider privacy and data protection regulations when handling voice data.\n\n# IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS\n1. Create a button in the Jira ticket creation form to initiate voice recording.\n2. Implement logic to capture audio input from the microphone.\n3. Use the Web Speech API to convert the audio to text.\n4. Populate the Jira ticket fields with the transcribed text.\n5. Store the audio files securely and associate them with the respective Jira tickets.\n\nSample code snippet:\n\\`\\`\\`\nfunction startRecording() {\n    // Logic to start recording audio\n}\n\nfunction convertSpeechToText(audioData) {\n    // Utilize Web Speech API to transcribe audio to text\n}\n\nfunction populateTicketFields(transcribedText) {\n    // Populate Jira ticket fields with transcribed text\n}\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nPotential challenge:\n- Ensuring accurate transcription under varying audio quality conditions.\n- Solution: Implement error handling and offer users the option to edit the transcribed text.\n\n# ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA\n- Users can record voice messages within the Jira ticket creation form.\n- The recorded voice messages are accurately transcribed and populated in the ticket fields.\n- The transcribed text is editable before final submission.\n- Voice messages are securely stored and associated with the respective tickets.\n\nEdge case:\n- Handling situations where the audio quality is poor or the speech is unclear.\n\n# TESTING CONSIDERATIONS\n- Unit tests for audio recording and transcription functions.\n- Integration tests to verify the end-to-end flow of recording, transcription, and populating ticket fields.\n- Performance testing to ensure the feature does not impact the responsiveness of the Jira platform.\n\n# DEPENDENCIES & RISKS\nDependencies:\n- Integration with the Jira platform for capturing and storing voice messages.\n- Compliance with data protection laws and regulations.\n\nRisks:\n- Inaccurate transcription leading to incorrect ticket details.\n- Mitigation: Provide users with the option to review and edit transcribed text before submission."
